## Afterword

This template was inspired by the "[让2025成为人生最棒的一年⁉️ iPad计划本](https://youtu.be/9z2S59P5kNw?si=Z3jB6FygxpCl0gRb)," specifically the "Memory Record" section.

I used Elena Lin's planner before, and by the end of the year, I realized I only filled out the memory record section (mentioned at 8:00 in the video). So, I thought, why not turn that part into a Notion version? It’s designed specifically for people who are too lazy to write diaries (like me xD). You just need to jot down 0-1 sentences about what you did today or any milestones you achieved. By the end of the year, you’ll still have a clear view of how your year went.

At the same time, it keeps some flexibility. If you want to write more detailed entries, you can add notes or photos. Plus, there are specific themed templates (Gratitude, Gatherings, Parenting, Movies) to help you quickly document your life.
