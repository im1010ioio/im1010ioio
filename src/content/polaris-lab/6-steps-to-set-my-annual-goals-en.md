## Afterword

This template was inspired by  
"[Better Leaf 好葉 - 怎樣設定令人振奮的年度目標 - 2021年最強目標！ - 《葬禮遊戲》](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoGHwlDz6Ow)".

When I first learned about this goal-setting method, I tried planning with it and found it very helpful. Although I didn't write down every detail, this reflection gave me a clear direction and reduced my anxiety.

I want to use this method again this year to examine my goals, so I created this Notion template. Since this idea didn't come from me alone, I won't sell this template and it's free for everyone to use.

Happy New Year!  
I hope this template can help you achieve your goals. :)
